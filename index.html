                    <div class="flex-title">About me</div>
                    <p>I'm a 24-year-old IT enthusiast from Szczecin. I started my way in programming as a
                        front-end developer less than 2 years ago. Firstly as a freelancer and later as a front end
                        developer in my home town.
                        Right now apart from working, I'm studying IT and econometrics on the University of
                        Szczecin on a master degree.</p>
                    <p>I learn quick and work hard. Coding is not only my job,
                        that's my hobby.</p>
                    <p>I'm still learning. Currently PHP and MySQL basics on course organized by foundation in
                        Szczecin.
                        Moreover last week I finished WebCamp organized by IAI company. It took 5 days. I've learned a
                        lot and got even more
                        into Web Developing.</p>

                    <div class="flex-title">My experience</div>
                    <p>I'm fully committed to my job and I really enjoy every
                        day of it. I have still growing experience and a few projects on the way. In my career, I had
                        an
                        opportunity to work on many projects and developed quite good coding skills. More about
                        projects I've been working in are a bit further.</p>
                    <p> I code everyday using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Bulma, SCSS/ LESS, React.js,
                        Angular, GIT, JIRA. I am also getting better in PHP and MySQL. I know how to work in SCRUM. To
                        design, I use Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo, Adobe XD and Figma.
                        Currently, I'm working on React.js project and developing skills in other Javascript
                        frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm advanced in English. Writing or reading documentation is part of my job so I'm not afraid of
                        any tasks. I was also intermediate in German, but I wasn't using it for a while.</p>
